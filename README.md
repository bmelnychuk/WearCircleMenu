### Integration
For now you can just use *.java files, there are no resources files. But if do need this as gradle dependecy, I can do that, just post an issue

### Thanks
This implementation is based on sababado's CircularView https://github.com/sababado/CircularView. That suits me perfecly, but it comes with its own limitations and maybe bugs (though I did found ones). Enjoy!
